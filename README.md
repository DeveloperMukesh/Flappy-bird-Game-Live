# [Flappy Bird](https://youtube.com/@life_mukeshnath?si=wB7Rk_eQqd6-H0Kr)

This file is  to create the flappy bird game with html, css, and javascript. Specifically, you get all code in my github . game using html5 canvas. 

Throughout the game, you will see how to create the game loop, add images onto the canvas, add click handlers to make the flappy bird jump, randomly generate pipes and move them across the screen, detect collisions between the flappy bird and each pipe, and add a running score.
